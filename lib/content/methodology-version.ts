/**
 * Methodology versioning surface.
 *
 * The /methodology route points at the current version. Historical
 * versions remain reachable at /methodology/v1-1, /methodology/v1-2,
 * etc., so any external citation against an older version stays
 * resolvable. When a new version ships:
 *
 *   1. Add the new slug to `METHODOLOGY_VERSIONS`.
 *   2. Bump `CURRENT_METHODOLOGY` to that slug.
 *   3. Bump `SITE.methodologyVersion` in `lib/content/site.ts`.
 *   4. Build `/app/[locale]/methodology/<new-slug>/page.tsx`.
 *   5. Update existing version pages with a "superseded by …" header.
